## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/mcereal/ibm_db2/issues). Before submitting a bug report, please check if an issue already exists. If it does, add any additional information you have as a comment.

When reporting a bug, please include:

- Any **relevant logs or screenshots**.
- The version of the package you are using.

### Suggesting Features

We welcome feature suggestions! To suggest a new feature, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/mcereal/ibm_db2/issues) and describe the feature you'd like to see, the problem it solves, and any relevant examples or use cases. This will help us understand the context and potential impact of the feature.

### Improving Documentation

Documentation is key to any open-source project. You can contribute by improving our documentation:

- **Fix typos or grammatical errors**.
- **Improve existing explanations**.
- **Add new examples** or use cases.

Submit documentation improvements directly as a [pull request](https://github.com/mcereal/ibm_db2/pulls).
